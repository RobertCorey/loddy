    <h1>About Post Truth Trivia</h1>
    <p>
      <i>Post Truth Trivia</i> is an online party game for 3-8 players. Unlike
      other boring trivia games the actual answer to the questions do not
      matter. In <i>Post Truth Trivia</i> the answers to questions are whatever
      other players in the game think they are. Does Uncle John think The Matrix
      was released in 2007? Then you better swallow your nerd pride and type in
      2007. The closer you are to the “Answer” the more points you get.

    <p><i>Post Truth Trivia</i>, it’s 2020 and the facts don't matter.</p>
